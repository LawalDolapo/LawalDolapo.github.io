	 <h1> The Golden One </h1>
<p>Lol, I'm sure ure wondering who i'm calling the golden one, well its no one other than my mum, The most amazing woman i've ever met. </p>
<p> My relationship started with Mrs Idiat Lawal aka mama faaji 19 years and a few months ago, when i was birthed to her. She's a 
broadcaster by profession and currently works for Lagos state radio service.</p>
<p> Broadcasting is a lovely and time consuming profession hence broadcasters don't have a lot of time to spare. Sometimes i wonder if she
studied a course in time management or there is a secret somewhere because she's made time for all important events in my life from graduation and End 
of the year parties to visiting days in my days of secondary school. </p>

<p> She's an indigene of Kwara state and is you'll call a butty. She's fair, God-fearing, loving, caring and all the good qualities i can think of, so its also
nice to note that i got a fair amount of her worthy characters, social ettiquettes and behaviours.</br> She's managed to draw a line between her personal and proffesional life,
with the publicity and all. Another great perk of having a great broadcaster as a mother is that we got to meet broadcasters and journalists, and also speaking 
live on air!!!, Amazing huh!. </p>
<p> Growing up with her was easy as she's a considerate and an easy going person who loves her family. we weren't spared for the normal yoruba smacks and slaps
when we needed the discipline. Another form of discipling was in the exercise punishments meted out which you can never imagine to be stressful. She's the best 
mother i can ever have and i love her with all my heart.</br>
P.S I'm a momma's boy.</p>
