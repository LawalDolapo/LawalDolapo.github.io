   <h1><b> THE LAWALS </b></h1>
   <hr/>
 <intro> I am lawal Dolapo, I'm a student of Unilag and I'm about to intoduce you to my family </intro> 
 <p> Hello,</br>
The lawals is a small knit family consisting of my parents and Three boys. First of all, lemme talk about me </p>
<p>
My name full name is lawal Trimidhi Dolapo, I'm a muslim and I was born on the 20th of january 1997, which means I'm 19 years, if you do the math correctly. 
I currently live in ikorodu with my loving family.</p>
<P> I'm the first child of this family, and its been fun all the way. Even the responsibilities of being the first child is not really breaking me, as i tend 
to enjoy the power and authority when Im left in Charge of my siblings whenever my parents aren't around. Also being the eldest means i get to organise most 
of the mischiefs we were involved in back then, also have to take responsibility when it backfires, which it does mostly.</p>

<p> I'm currently studying building contruction in the university of lagos, in my 300 level.<br />
I can call myself an easygoing person, very curious in nature, a passionate Gamer and have a knack for learning new cool intresting stuffs. I guess thats 
why I devlved into programming. Dolapo can be an introvert sometimes and he can be very quiet when he chooses to.</p>
<p>I'm not the most social person in the world, but i do have a social life which can be boring to a lot of people, but hey 
its my life and it can be really cool in a nerdy way.</p>
<p> Back to my family, I have two amazing brothers and no sister and my loving parents.</br>
  My dad is not always around because of his work which is based in Abuja, but he gets to world all over Nigeria and i get to talk to him everyday, 
  he also comes home as frequent as he can, but i still miss him alot.</p>
<p>Let me stop boring you with my boring self and lets go meet the rest of the family</p>
